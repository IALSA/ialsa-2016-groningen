# Guide to Models

Each of the following models (`A`, `B`, `AA`, and `BB`) are fitted to the data from each study separately. When fitted to the pooled data, an additional predictor, `study_name` is added after the intercept. 


|predictors/model   | A | B |AA |BB | best |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|age              |age_in_years_70 |age_in_years_70   |age_in_years_70   |age_in_years_70   | ?|
|sex              |female       |female         |female         |female         | ?|

Odds-ratios with 95% confidence intervals are reported. The model labeled "best" represents the solution suggested by the top ranked model from the best subset search propelled by genetic algorithm with AICC as the guiding selection criteria. 

# Dynamic tables

## Between models
The following table reports comparison across five model types (A, B, AA, BB, best) and six datasets (alsa, lbsl, satsa, share, tilda, pooled).   You can think of this as multiple tables stacked on top of each other. You select a single table by choosing the value for `study_name`.  (you may need to adjust the number of entries to view, at the top left of the dynamic table)
```{r dynamic-between, echo=FALSE, results='show', eval=T}
```


## Within models
The following table reports estimates and odds from every model that has been fit during the exercise. You can think of this as multiple tables of various heights stacked on top of each other. You select a single table by chosing the values for `study_name` and `model_type`.   (you may need to adjust the number of entries to view, at the top left of the dynamic table)
```{r dynamic-within, echo=FALSE, results='show', eval=T}
```


# Static tables

```{r static-pooled, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=T}
```


```{r static-local, echo=FALSE, results='asis', eval=T}
```




# session
```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
