<!-- Set the report-wide options, and point to the external code file. -->

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

# Exposition

## Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto_h.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r
# the list is composed of the following elements
names(dto)
```

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData"

This dataset, which includes harmonized variables, will be used to fit the models. 

According to the rules of the exercise,however, only the participants over the age of 50 were kept for the analysis: 


```r
# restrict analysis to respondents age 50+
ds <- ds %>% 
  dplyr::filter(age_in_years >= 50) 
```



# Harmonization rules

This section narrates the harmonization rules applied to candidate variables from each study and provides the descriptives of harmonized variables


Harmonization has been carried out by sequential execution of the follwoing scripts:


- [`./reports/harmonize-smoking/harmonize-smoking.R`][h1]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-age/harmonize-age.R`][h2]
- [`./reports/harmonize-sex/harmonize-sex.R`][h3]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-marital/harmonize-marital.R`][h4]
- [`./reports/harmonize-education/harmonize-education.R`][h5]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-work/harmonize-work.R`][h6]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-alcohol/harmonize-alcohol.R`][h7]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-physact/harmonize-physact.R`][h8]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-health/harmonize-health.R`][h9]  
- [`./reports/harmonize-physique/harmonize-physique.R`][h10]  


the  reports are produced by knitting their respective `.Rmd` files, located in corresponding folders.  

The following subsections provide summary details on the harmonization implemented to produce each target variable. Please refer to full reports listed above for further details.

## Smoking 
View [descriptives : smoking](/https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-smoking.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Are you a smoker presently?**  - `smoke_now`

  - `0` - `FALSE` - *healthy* - Reference group  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - *unhealthy* - Risk factor

#### **Have you ever smoked?**  - `smoked_ever`

  - `0` - `FALSE` - *healthy* - Reference group  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - *unhealthy* - Risk factor

## Age

View [descriptives : age](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-age.html) for closer examination of raw variables. For each study, three variables have been formulated and computed:  

* `year_of_wave` - Calendar year in which the measurement wave occured. These data values are added manually, after consulting respective study's documentation.     
* `year_born` - Calendar year in which the respondent was born    
* `age_in_years` - Age of respondent in years

## Marital status
View [descriptives : marital](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-marital.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

The responses to variables loading on the construct `marital` are as such:
![marital raw](../../libs/images/harmonize/harmonize-marital-raw.PNG )

After reorganizing the possible repsonses, the following clustering has emerged

![marital harmonized](../../libs/images/harmonize/harmonize-marital-harmonized.PNG )

After reviewing descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables have been adopted:

#### **Current marital status**  - `marital`

  - `-1` - `mar_cohab` - married or cohabiting  
  - `0` - `single`- not married - REFERENCE group  
  - `1` - `widowed` - widowed  
  - `2` - `sep_divorced` - separated or divorced  

However, such categorization resulted in data sparseness: some categories were not populated heavily enough to allow for convergence during estimation. To address this, a simpler harmonization rule has been adopted :
  
#### **Current marital status**  - `single`

  - `0` - `FALSE` - married / living together - Reference group  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - single / lining along

View [descriptives : work](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-work.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Is respondent currently in the work force?**  - `current_work_2`
- `0` - `FALSE` - Reference group
- `1` - `TRUE` - Risk factor

The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors.  

The operationalization of this variable ***does not*** distinguish between retired and unemployed statuses. 


```r
t <- table( ds$current_work_2,ds$study_name,useNA="always");t[t==0]<-".";t
```

```
       
        alsa lbsl satsa share tilda <NA>
  FALSE 2038 372  916   1617  5094  .

## Alcohol
View [descriptives : alcohol](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-alcohol.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Does respondent currently consume alcohol?**  - `current_drink`
  - `0` - `FALSE`- Reference group
  - `1` - `TRUE`- Risk factor 

The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors. 

The operationalization of this variable ***is not*** sensitive to the intensity of consumption: any indications of non-abstaining generated `TRUE` values on the harmonizaed variable. It also doesn't account for the history of consumption, reflecting only the present habits. 


```r
t <- table( ds$current_drink,ds$study_name, useNA="always");t[t==0]<-".";t
```

```
       
        alsa lbsl satsa share tilda <NA>
  FALSE 774  168  515   1785  1779  .

# Harmonized dataset



# Guide to Models

Each of the following models (`A`, `B`, `AA`, and `BB`) are fitted to the data from each study separately. When fitted to the pooled data, an additional predictor, `study_name` is added after the intercept. 


|predictors/model   | A | B |AA |BB | best |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|age              |age_in_years |age_in_years   |age_in_years   |age_in_years   | ?|

Odds-ratios with 95% confidence intervals are reported. The model labeled "best" represents the solution suggested by the top ranked model from the best subset search propelled by genetic algorithm with AICC as the guiding selection criteria. 

# Between models
The following table reports comparison across five model types (A, B, AA, BB, best) and six datasets (alsa, lbsl, satsa, share, tilda, pooled).   You can think of this as multiple tables of various heights stacked on top of each other. You select a single table by choosing the value for `study_name`.  (you may need to adjust the number of entries to view, at the top left of the dynamic table)

# Within models
The following table reports estimates and odds from every model that has been fit during the exercise. You can think of this as multiple tables of various heights stacked on top of each other. You select a single table by chosing the values for `study_name` and `model_type`.   (you may need to adjust the number of entries to view, at the top left of the dynamic table)
