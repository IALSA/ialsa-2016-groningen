> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

# Exposition

## Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->
```{r load-data, echo=T, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->
```{r inspect-data, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


## Meta
```{r meta-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Tweak the datasets.   -->
```{r tweak-data, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Basic table view.   -->
```{r basic-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


## Assembly
 The dto containing harmonized operationalizations is queried to assemble analysis-ready dataset.

```{r assemble, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

This dataset, which includes harmonized variables, will be used to fit the models. 

# Harmonization rules

```

## Age

View [descriptives : age](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-age.html) for closer examination of raw variables. For each study, three variables have been formulated and computed:  

* `year_of_wave` - Calendar year in which the measurement wave occured. These data values are added manually, after consulting respective study's documentation.     
* `year_born` - Calendar year in which the respondent was born    
* `age_in_years` - Age of respondent in years

#### **Is respondent female?**  - `female`

  - `0` - `FALSE` - male - Reference group  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - female

## Education
View [descriptives : education](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-education.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Highest level of education achieved**  - `educ3`
  - `-1` - `less then high school` 
  - `0` - `high school` -  Reference group 
  - `1` - `more than high school`

The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors.     
  
```{r basic-frequencies-predictors-3, echo=echoChunks}
```



## Marital status
View [descriptives : marital](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-marital.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

The responses to variables loading on the construct `marital` are as such:
![marital raw](../../libs/images/harmonize/harmonize-marital-raw.PNG )

After reorganizing the possible repsonses, the following clustering has emerged

![marital harmonized](../../libs/images/harmonize/harmonize-marital-harmonized.PNG )

After reviewing descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables have been adopted:

#### **Current marital status**  - `marital`

  - `-1` - `mar_cohab` - married or cohabiting  
  - `0` - `single`- not married - REFERENCE group  
  - `1` - `widowed` - widowed  
  - `2` - `sep_divorced` - separated or divorced  

However, such categorization resulted in data sparseness: some categories were not populated heavily enough to allow for convergence during estimation. To address this, a simpler harmonization rule has been adopted :
  
#### **Current marital status**  - `single`

  - `0` - `FALSE` - married / living together - Reference group  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - single / lining along 
  
The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors.

## Health (SR)
View [descriptives : health](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-physact.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Does respondent report poor health?**  - `poor_health`
  - `0` - `FALSE` - Reference group
  - `1` - `TRUE` - Risk factor
  
The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors.

## Physical activity
View [descriptives : physact](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-physact.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Does respondent lead a sendentary lifestyle?**  - `sedentary`
  - `0` - `FALSE` - Reference group
  - `1` - `TRUE` - Risk factor
  
The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors. 

The operationalization of this variable ***is not*** sensitive to the intensity of exercise. Any reponses indicating an activity at least as vigorous as ***walking*** generated values `TRUE` on the harmonized variable. 

```{r basic-frequencies-predictors-6, echo=echoChunks}
```


## Employment status
View [descriptives : work](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-work.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable.

The operationalization of this variable ***does not*** distinguish between retired and unemployed statuses. 

```{r basic-frequencies-predictors-7, echo=echoChunks}
```

## Alcohol
View [descriptives : alcohol](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-alcohol.html) for closer examination of each variable that contributed to the computation of the harmonized variable. 

#### **Does respondent currently consume alcohol?**  - `current_drink`
  - `0` - `FALSE`- Reference group
  - `1` - `TRUE`- Risk factor 

The specific [harmonization rules](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/h-rules) have been encoded over the [observed frequencies](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live) of unique response vectors. 

The operationalization of this variable ***is not*** sensitive to the intensity of consumption: any indications of non-abstaining generated `TRUE` values on the harmonizaed variable. It also doesn't account for the history of consumption, reflecting only the present habits.
