I do think the  main accomplishments will be as follows:

* 1. Read the five datasets into R, building out a section of code for transforming variables from each data set to a common naming format and permitting transformations to harmonize variables. This script can be shared with others as soon as possible through Matilda and the Maelstrom Wiki and your Github page.
* 2. The analysis is cross-sectional and a basic regression equation. It would be good to settle on this prediction model and run this independently for each of the studies as a first analysis step.
* 3. Make decisions about cut-points and other harmonization criteria and apply these for a pooled data analysis using the same prediction model. Run first without study-level dummy variables and another model with main effects for study differences (k-1 with one study serving as reference).
* 4. Examine alternative harmonization decisions and interactions of covariates with study-level dummy variables.
* 5. For the meeting, we will present this overall approach and our results, with attention to sensitivity of results across different decisions.
