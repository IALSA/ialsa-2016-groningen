# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r
# the list is composed of the following elements
names(dto)
```

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData" 
```

```r
# 1st element - names of the studies as character vector
dto[["studyName"]]
```

```

## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `physique`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script. 


```r
meta_data <- dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(construct %in% c('physique')) %>% 
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, construct, label_short, categories, url) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(construct, study_name)
knitr::kable(meta_data)

After reviewing descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `physique` have been adopted:


#### Target (1) : `bmi`   

from metric:

```r
bmi = weight_kg / height_m ^ 2
```

from imperial

```r
bmi = weight_lb * 703 / height_in ^ 2
```
  

These variables will be generated next, in the Development section. 

# (II) Development

The particulare goal of this section is to ensure that the schema to encode the values for the `physique` variable is consisten across studies. 

In this section we will define the schema sets for harmonizing `physique` construct (i.e.  specify which variables from which studies will be contributing to computing harmonized variables ). Each of these schema sets will have a particular pattern of possible response values to these variables, which we will export for inspection as `.csv` tables. We then will manually edit these `.csv` tables, populating new columns that will map values of harmonized variables to the specific response pattern of the schema set variables. We then will import harmonization algorithms encoded in `.csv` tables and apply them to compute harmonized variables in the dataset combining raw and harmonized variables for `physique` construct across studies.

## (II.A) 


### (1) Schema sets
Having all potential variables in categorical format we have defined the sets of data schema variables thus: 



## (II.B) `bmi`

from metric:

```r
bmi = weight_kg / height_m ^ 2
```

from imperial

```r
bmi = weight_lb * 703 / height_in ^ 2
```

### ALSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `bmi`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name=="alsa", construct %in% c("physique")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label,categories)
```

```
  study_name   name               label categories
1       alsa WEIGHT Weight in kilograms         NA
```

ALSA is lacking the measure of height. It is not possible to calculate `bmi` for this study. 

```r
dto[["unitData"]][["alsa"]] <- dto[["unitData"]][["alsa"]] %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(
      HIEGHT = NA,
      bmi = (WEIGHT)/ (HIEGHT^2))
# verify
dto[["unitData"]][["alsa"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(id %in% sample(unique(id),10)) %>%
  dplyr::select_("id", "WEIGHT","HIEGHT", "bmi")
```

```
      id WEIGHT HIEGHT bmi
1   1302   50.0     NA  NA
2   5031   73.2     NA  NA
3   7501   65.9     NA  NA
4   8452   76.4     NA  NA
5  12521   56.4     NA  NA
6  12732   61.8     NA  NA
7  17761   71.4     NA  NA
8  26111   65.9     NA  NA
9  28691   93.0     NA  NA
10 35621   63.6     NA  NA
```


### LBSL
Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `bmi`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "lbsl", construct == "physique") %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
  study_name     name                    label_short categories
1       lbsl HEIGHT94               Height in Inches         NA
2       lbsl WEIGHT94               Weight in Pounds         NA
3       lbsl  HWEIGHT Self-reported weight in pounds         NA
4       lbsl  HHEIGHT Self-reported height in inches         NA
```
We compute `bmi` according to the declared formula:  

```r
dto[["unitData"]][["lbsl"]] <- dto[["unitData"]][["lbsl"]] %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(bmi = (WEIGHT94 * 703)/ (HEIGHT94^2))
# verify
dto[["unitData"]][["lbsl"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(id %in% sample(unique(id),10)) %>%
  dplyr::select_("id", "WEIGHT94","HEIGHT94", "bmi")
```

### TILDA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `bmi`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "tilda", construct == "physique") %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
  study_name                  name        label_short categories
1      tilda SR.HEIGHT.CENTIMETRES Height Centimetres         NA
2      tilda                HEIGHT  Respondent height         NA
3      tilda SR.WEIGHT.KILOGRAMMES Weight Kilogrammes         NA
4      tilda                WEIGHT  Respondent weight         NA
```
We compute `bmi` according to the declared formula:  

```r
ds <- dto[["unitData"]][["tilda"]]
ds <- ds %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    weight = ifelse(
    !is.na(WEIGHT), WEIGHT, ifelse(
      !is.na(SR.WEIGHT.KILOGRAMMES),SR.WEIGHT.KILOGRAMMES, NA)),
    height = ifelse(
      !is.na(HEIGHT), HEIGHT, ifelse(
        !is.na(SR.HEIGHT.CENTIMETRES),SR.HEIGHT.CENTIMETRES, NA))
  ) 
ds <- ds %>%
  dplyr::mutate(bmi = (weight)/ ((height/100)^2))
dto[["unitData"]][["tilda"]] <- ds
# verify
dto[["unitData"]][["tilda"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(id %in% sample(unique(id),10)) %>%
  dplyr::select_("id","weight", "height", "bmi")
```

```
                   id weight height      bmi

# (III) Recapitulation 

At this point the `dto[["unitData"]]` elements (raw data files for each study) have been augmented with the harmonized variable `bmi`. 


```r
dumlist <- list()
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  ds <- dto[["unitData"]][[s]]
  dumlist[[s]] <- ds[,c("id","bmi")]
}
ds <- plyr::ldply(dumlist,data.frame,.id = "study_name")
head(ds)
```

```
  study_name  id bmi
1       alsa  41  NA
2       alsa  42  NA
3       alsa  61  NA
4       alsa  71  NA
5       alsa  91  NA
6       alsa 121  NA
```

```r
ds$id <- 1:nrow(ds) # some ids values might be identical, replace
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  print(s)
  print(summary(dto[["unitData"]][[s]]$bmi))
}
```

```

```


Finally, we have added the newly created, harmonized variables to the raw source objects and save the data transfer object.


```r
# Save as a compress, binary R dataset.  It's no longer readable with a text editor, but it saves metadata (eg, factor information).
saveRDS(dto, file="./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds", compress="xz")
```
