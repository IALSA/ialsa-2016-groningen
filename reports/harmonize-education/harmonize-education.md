# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r
# the list is composed of the following elements
names(dto)
```

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData" 
```

```r
# 1st element - names of the studies as character vector
dto[["studyName"]]
```

```
[1] "alsa"  "lbsl"  "satsa" "share" "tilda"
```

## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `education`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script. 


```r
meta_data <- dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(construct %in% c('education')) %>% 
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, construct, label_short, categories, url) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(construct, study_name)
knitr::kable(meta_data)
```

View [descriptives : education](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-education.html) for closer examination of each candidate. 

After reviewing descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `education` have been adopted:

#### Target (1) : `educ4`   
  - `1` - `less then high-school` 
  - `2` - `high-school most` 
  - `3` - `college`
  - `4` - `college plus`
  

These variables will be generated next, in the Development section. 

# (II) Development

The particulare goal of this section is to ensure that the schema to encode the values for the `education` variable is consisten across studies. 

In this section we will define the schema sets for harmonizing `education` construct (i.e.  specify which variables from which studies will be contributing to computing harmonized variables ). Each of these schema sets will have a particular pattern of possible response values to these variables, which we will export for inspection as `.csv` tables. We then will manually edit these `.csv` tables, populating new columns that will map values of harmonized variables to the specific response pattern of the schema set variables. We then will import harmonization algorithms encoded in `.csv` tables and apply them to compute harmonized variables in the dataset combining raw and harmonized variables for `education` construct across studies.

## (II.A) 


### (1) Schema sets
Having all potential variables in categorical format we have defined the sets of data schema variables thus: 

Each of these schema sets  have a particular pattern of possible response values, for example:


We output these tables into self-standing `.csv` files, so we can manually provide the logic of computing harmonized variables.



You can examine them in [`./data/meta/response-profiles-live/](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live)

## (II.B) `educ4`

#### Target (1) : `educ4`   
  - `1` - `less then high-school` 
  - `2` - `high-school most` 
  - `3` - `college`
  - `4` - `college plus`
  

### ALSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `education`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name=="alsa", construct %in% c("education")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label,categories)
```

```
  study_name    name                 label categories
1       alsa  SCHOOL       Age left school          8
2       alsa TYPQUAL Highest qualification         10
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "alsa"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-education-alsa.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("SCHOOL","TYPQUAL"), 
  harmony_name = "educ4"
)
```

```

### SHARE

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `education`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "share", construct == "education") %>%
  # dplyr::filter(name %in% c("DN0100")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
   study_name     name                            label_short categories
1       share   DN0100                              Edcuation         13

10      share DN012DRF                                refused         NA
11      share DN012DDK                              dont know         NA
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "share"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-education-share.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("DN0100","DN012D01","DN012D02","DN012D03",
                     "DN012D04","DN012D05","DN012D09", "DN012DNO", "DN012DOT",
                     "DN012DRF", "DN012DDK"), 
  harmony_name = "educ4"
)
```

### TILDA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `education`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "tilda", construct == "education") %>%
  # dplyr::filter(name %in% c("SMK94", "SMOKE")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
  study_name  name label_short categories
1      tilda DM001                      4
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "tilda"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-education-tilda.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("DM001"), 
  harmony_name = "educ4"
)
```

```

# (III) Recapitulation 

At this point the `dto[["unitData"]]` elements (raw data files for each study) have been augmented with the harmonized variable `education`. We retrieve harmonized variables to view frequency counts across studies: 


```r
dumlist <- list()
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  ds <- dto[["unitData"]][[s]]
  dumlist[[s]] <- ds[,c("id","educ4")]
}
ds <- plyr::ldply(dumlist,data.frame,.id = "study_name")
head(ds)
```

```
  study_name  id                 educ4
1       alsa  41               college
2       alsa  42 less than high-school
3       alsa  61 less than high-school
4       alsa  71      high-school most
5       alsa  91 less than high-school
6       alsa 121 less than high-school
```

```r
ds$id <- 1:nrow(ds) # some ids values might be identical, replace
ds$educ4 <- ordered(
