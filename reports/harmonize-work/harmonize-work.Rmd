# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->
```{r load-data, echo=T, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->
```{r inspect-data, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


### Meta
```{r meta-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Tweak the datasets.   -->
```{r tweak-data, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Basic table view.   -->
```{r basic-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `work status`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script. 

```{r view-metadata-1, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

View [descriptives : work](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-work.html) for closer examination of each candidate. 

After reviewing descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `work status` have been adopted:


#### Target (1) : `current_work_2`   
- `0` - `FALSE` 
- `1` - `TRUE`
  

These variables will be generated next, in the Development section. 

# (II) Development

The particulare goal of this section is to ensure that the schema to encode the values for the `work status` variable is consisten across studies. 

In this section we will define the schema sets for harmonizing `work status` construct (i.e.  specify which variables from which studies will be contributing to computing harmonized variables ). Each of these schema sets will have a particular pattern of possible response values to these variables, which we will export for inspection as `.csv` tables. We then will manually edit these `.csv` tables, populating new columns that will map values of harmonized variables to the specific response pattern of the schema set variables. We then will import harmonization algorithms encoded in `.csv` tables and apply them to compute harmonized variables in the dataset combining raw and harmonized variables for `work status` construct across studies.

## (II.A) 


### (1) Schema sets
Having all potential variables in categorical format we have defined the sets of data schema variables thus: 
```{r II-A-2-schema-sets-1, echo=TRUE}
```  
Each of these schema sets  have a particular pattern of possible response values, for example:

```{r II-A-2-schema-sets-2, echo=TRUE}
```  
We output these tables into self-standing `.csv` files, so we can manually provide the logic of computing harmonized variables.

```{r II-A-2-schema-sets-3, echo=TRUE}
```  

You can examine them in [`./data/meta/response-profiles-live/](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live)

## (II.B) `current_work_2`

#### Target (1) : `current_work_2`   
- `0` - `FALSE` 
- `1` - `TRUE`

### ALSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `current_work_2`  are:
```{r II-B-work-alsa-1, echo=TRUE}
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 
```{r II-B-work-alsa-2, echo=TRUE}
```


### LBSL
Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `current_work_2`  are:
```{r II-B-work-lbsl-1, echo=TRUE}
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 
```{r II-B-work-lbsl-2, echo=TRUE}
```


### SATSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `current_work_2`  are:
```{r II-B-work-satsa-1, echo=TRUE}
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 
```{r II-B-work-satsa-2, echo=TRUE}
```

### SHARE

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `current_work_2`  are:
```{r II-B-work-share-1, echo=TRUE}
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 
```{r II-B-work-share-2, echo=TRUE}
```


### TILDA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `current_work_2`  are:
```{r II-B-work-tilda-1, echo=TRUE}
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 
```{r II-B-work-tilda-2, echo=TRUE}
```



# (III) Recapitulation 

At this point the `dto[["unitData"]]` elements (raw data files for each study) have been augmented with the harmonized variable `current_work_2`. We retrieve harmonized variables to view frequency counts across studies: 

```{r III-A-assembly, echo=TRUE}
```
