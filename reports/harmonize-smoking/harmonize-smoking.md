# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/meta/names-labels-live/names-labels-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/meta/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData"

## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `smoking`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script. 


```r
meta_data <- dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(construct %in% c('smoking')) %>% 
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, construct, label_short, categories, url) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(construct, study_name)
knitr::kable(meta_data)
```

View [descriptives : smoking](/reports/harmonization-smoking/harmonization-smoking-basic-graphs.md) for closer examination of each candidate.  After reviewing  these descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `smoking` have been adopted:

#### (1) `smoke_now` :  **Are you a smoker presently?**  
  - `0` - `FALSE` - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - *unhealthy choice*   
  
#### (2) `smoked_ever` **Have you ever smoked?**  
  - `0` - `FALSE` - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - `TRUE` - *unhealthy choice* 

These two variables will be manufactured by qualitative harmonization in the Development section. 
 
# (II) Development

In this section we will define the schema sets for harmonizing `smoking` construct (i.e.  specify which variables from which studies will be contributing to computing harmonized variables ). Each of these schema sets (e.g. `"alsa" = c("SMOKER", "PIPCIGAR")`) will have a particular pattern of possible response values to these variables(e.g. "id_1" = c("SMOKER"="YES", "PIPCIGAR"="NO")), which we will export for inspection as `.csv` tables. We then will manually edit these `.csv` tables, populating new columns that will map values of harmonized variables to the specific response pattern of the schema set variables. We then will import harmonization algorithms encoded in `.csv` tables and apply them to compute harmonized variables in the dataset combining raw and harmonized variables for `smoking` construct across studies.

## (II.A) 

### (1) Categorization

Preliminary inspection of the schema sets variables revealed two continuous measures: 


```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>% dplyr::filter(study_name=="share", name=="BR0030") %>% dplyr::select(name,label)
```

```
    name                 label
1 BR0030 how many years smoked
```

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>% dplyr::filter(study_name=="tilda", name=="BH003") %>% dplyr::select(name,label)
```

```
   name                                             label
1 BH003 bh003  How old were you when you stopped smoking?
```

The variable `BR0030` of SATSA has been excluded from the Data Schema for operationalizing harmonized items of the construct `smoking`. We do not need to know *how long* they smoked, only that they *do not smoke* now.

The variable `BH003 ` of TILDA has been excluded from the Data Schema for operationalizing harmonized items of the construct `smoking`. We do not need to know *when* they quit, only that they *did* quit (or never smoked).


### (2) Schema sets
Having all potential variables in categorical format we have defined the sets of data schema variables thus: 

```r
schema_sets <- list(
  "alsa" = c("SMOKER", "PIPCIGAR"),
  "lbsl" = c("SMK94","SMOKE"),
  "satsa" = c("GSMOKNOW", "GEVRSMK","GEVRSNS"),
  "share" = c("BR0010","BR0020"), # "BR0030" is continuous
  "tilda" = c("BH001","BH002", "BEHSMOKER") # "BH003" is continuous
)
```
Each of these schema sets  have a particular pattern of possible response values, for example:


```r
# view the joint profile of responses
dto[["unitData"]][["alsa"]] %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(SMOKER, PIPCIGAR) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(count = n()) 
```

```
Source: local data frame [5 x 3]
Groups: SMOKER [?]

  SMOKER PIPCIGAR count
  (fctr)   (fctr) (int)
1    Yes      Yes     7
2    Yes       No   169
3     No      Yes    41
4     No       NA  1851
5     NA       NA    19
```
We output these tables into self-standing `.csv` files, so we can manually provide the logic of computing harmonized variables.


```r
# define function to extract profiles
response_profile <- function(dto, h_target, study, varnames_values){
  ds <- dto[["unitData"]][[study]]
  varnames_values <- lapply(varnames_values, as.symbol)   # Convert character vector to list of symbols
  d <- ds %>% 
    dplyr::group_by_(.dots=varnames_values) %>% 
    dplyr::summarize(count = n()) 
  write.csv(d,paste0("./data/meta/response-profiles-live/",h_target,"-",study,".csv"))
}
# extract response profile for data schema set from each study
for(s in names(schema_sets)){
  response_profile(dto,
                   study = s,
                   h_target = 'smoking',
                   varnames_values = schema_sets[[s]]
                   )
}
```

You can examine them in [`./data/meta/response-profiles-live/](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live)

## (II.B) `smoke_now`

> Are you a smoker presently?

- `0` - `FALSE` - *healthy choice*  
- `1` - `TRUE` - *unhealthy choice* 

### ALSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `smoke_now`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(name %in% c("SMOKER", "PIPCIGAR")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label,categories)
```

```
  study_name     name                                 label categories
1       alsa   SMOKER    Do you currently smoke cigarettes?          2
2       alsa PIPCIGAR Do you regularly smoke pipe or cigar?          2
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "alsa"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-smoking-alsa.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("SMOKER", "PIPCIGAR"), 
  harmony_name = "smoke_now"
)

### SATSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `smoke_now`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "satsa", construct == "smoking") %>%
  # dplyr::filter(name %in% c("SMK94", "SMOKE")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
  study_name     name             label_short categories
1      satsa  GEVRSMK   Do you smoke tobacco?          3

3      satsa GSMOKNOW Smoked some last month?          2
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "satsa"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-smoking-satsa.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("GEVRSMK", "GEVRSNS","GSMOKNOW"), 
  harmony_name = "smoke_now"
)

### SATSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `smoked_ever`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "satsa", construct == "smoking") %>%
  # dplyr::filter(name %in% c("SMK94", "SMOKE")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
  study_name     name             label_short categories
1      satsa  GEVRSMK   Do you smoke tobacco?          3
2      satsa  GEVRSNS      Do you take snuff?          3
3      satsa GSMOKNOW Smoked some last month?          2
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "satsa"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-smoking-satsa.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("GEVRSMK", "GEVRSNS","GSMOKNOW"), 
  harmony_name = "smoked_ever"
)
```

### SHARE

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `smoked_ever`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name == "share", construct == "smoking") %>%
  # dplyr::filter(name %in% c("SMK94", "SMOKE")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label_short,categories)
```

```
  study_name   name                           label_short categories
1      share BR0010 Ever smoked tobacco daily for a year?          2
2      share BR0020                     Smoke at present?          2
3      share BR0030                How many years smoked?         NA
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r

dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(

# (III) Recapitulation 

At this point the `dto[["unitData"]]` elements (raw data files for each study) have been augmented with the harmonized variables `smoke_now` and `smoked_ever`. We retrieve harmonized variables to view frequency counts across studies: 


```r
dumlist <- list()
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  ds <- dto[["unitData"]][[s]]
  dumlist[[s]] <- ds[,c("id","smoke_now","smoked_ever")]
}
ds <- plyr::ldply(dumlist,data.frame,.id = "study_name")
head(ds)
```

```
  study_name  id smoke_now smoked_ever
1       alsa  41     FALSE       FALSE
2       alsa  42     FALSE       FALSE
3       alsa  61     FALSE       FALSE
4       alsa  71     FALSE       FALSE
5       alsa  91     FALSE       FALSE
6       alsa 121     FALSE       FALSE
```

```r
ds$id <- 1:nrow(ds) # some ids values might be identical, replace
table( ds$smoke_now, ds$study_name, useNA = "always")
```

```
       
        alsa lbsl satsa share tilda <NA>
  FALSE 1851  480  1067  2186  6939    0
  TRUE   217   71   365   408  1564    0
  <NA>    19  105    65     4     1    0
```

```r
table( ds$smoked_ever, ds$study_name, useNA = "always")
```

```
       
        alsa lbsl satsa share tilda <NA>
  FALSE 1851  207   700  1542  3726    0
  TRUE   217  351   696  1052  4777    0
  <NA>    19   98   101     4     1    0
```

Finally, we have added the newly created, harmonized variables to the raw source objects and save the data transfer object.


```r
# Save as a compress, binary R dataset.  It's no longer readable with a text editor, but it saves metadata (eg, factor information).
saveRDS(dto, file="./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds", compress="xz")
```
