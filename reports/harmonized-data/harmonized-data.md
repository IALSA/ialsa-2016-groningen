# Harmonized Data

<!-- These two chunks should be added in the beginning of every .Rmd that you want to source an .R script -->
<!--  The 1st mandatory chunck  -->
<!--  Set the working directory to the repository's base directory -->


<!--  The 2nd mandatory chunck  -->
<!-- Set the report-wide options, and point to the external code file. -->


This report combines harmonized variables from all studies into a single data set with `study_name` as a factor.

# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r
# the list is composed of the following elements
names(dto)
```

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData" 
```

```r
# 1st element - names of the studies as character vector
dto[["studyName"]]
```

```
[1] "alsa"  "lbsl"  "satsa" "share" "tilda"

We test the harmonized data with a simple logistic regression

  formula = smoke_now ~ -1 + study_name + age_in_years + female + marital + educ3, 
  data = ds, family = "binomial"
  )
