<!--  The 1st mandatory chunck  -->
<!--  Set the working directory to the repository's base directory -->

# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r
# the list is composed of the following elements
names(dto)
```

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData" 
```

```r
# 1st element - names of the studies as character vector
dto[["studyName"]]
```

```

## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `age`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script. 


```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(construct %in% c('age')) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-url, -label, -notes) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(study_name, item) %>%
  base::print()  
```

```

6      tilda    AGE                     age_interview       age demo         33
```

View [descriptives : age](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-age.html) for closer examination of each candidates.  After reviewing  these descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following harmonization target for construct `age` have been adopted.   

Each study is to provide:

* `year_of_wave` - the calendaric year in which the measurement wave occured. These data values are added manually, after consulting respective study's documentation.   
* `year_born` - the calendaric year in which the respondent was born  
* `age_in_years` - the age of respondent in years   

  

These variables will be generated next, in the Development section. 
 
# (II) Development

We export DataSchema variables for `age` into a single object for easier handling.


```r
get_these_variables <- c("id", "AGE","QAGE3","AGE94","YRBORN","DN0030")
dmls <- list() # dummy list
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  ds <- dto[["unitData"]][[s]] # get study data from dto
  (varnames <- names(ds)) # see what variables there are
  (variables_present <- varnames %in% get_these_variables) # variables on the list
  dmls[[s]] <- ds[,variables_present] # keep only them
}
lapply(dmls, names) # view the contents of the list object
```

```
$alsa
[1] "id"  "AGE"

$lbsl
[1] "id"    "AGE94"

$satsa
[1] "id"     "YRBORN" "QAGE3" 

$share
[1] "id"     "DN0030"

$tilda
[1] "id"  "AGE"
```

Next, variables will be renamed and computed to fill the mold of the harmonization target.

# III. Recapitulation

At this point the `dto[["unitData"]]` elements (raw data files for each study) have been augmented with the harmonized variables `year_of_wave`,`age_in_years`, amd `year_born`. We retrieve harmonized variables to view frequency counts across studies: 


```r
# convert the dummy list into a dataframe with study names as factor
ds <- plyr::ldply(dmls,data.frame,.id = "study_name")
ds$id <- 1:nrow(ds) # some ids values might be identical, replace
head(ds); str(ds)
```

```
  study_name id year_of_wave age_in_years year_born
1       alsa  1         1992           86      1906
2       alsa  2         1992           78      1914
3       alsa  3         1992           89      1903
4       alsa  4         1992           78      1914
5       alsa  5         1992           85      1907
6       alsa  6         1992           92      1900
```

```
'data.frame':	15342 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ study_name  : Factor w/ 5 levels "alsa","lbsl",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ id          : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ year_of_wave: num  1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 ...
 $ age_in_years: num  86 78 89 78 85 92 74 80 99 85 ...
 $ year_born   : num  1906 1914 1903 1914 1907 ...
```

```r
# augment dto with the harmonized age variables
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  d <- dto[["unitData"]][[s]]
  d <- d %>% 
    dplyr::left_join(dmls[[s]], by = "id")
  dto[["unitData"]][[s]] <- d
  
}
```


Finally, we have added the newly created, harmonized variables to the raw source objects and save the data transfer object.


```r
# Save as a compress, binary R dataset.  It's no longer readable with a text editor, but it saves metadata (eg, factor information).
saveRDS(dto, file="./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds", compress="xz")
```
