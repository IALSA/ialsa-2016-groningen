# Harmonize: physical activity

<!-- These two chunks should be added in the beginning of every .Rmd that you want to source an .R script -->
<!--  The 1st mandatory chunck  -->
<!--  Set the working directory to the repository's base directory -->


<!--  The 2nd mandatory chunck  -->
<!-- Set the report-wide options, and point to the external code file. -->


This report lists the candidate variable for DataScheme variables of the construct **physical activity**.

# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->

```r
# the list is composed of the following elements
names(dto)
```

```
[1] "studyName" "filePath"  "unitData"  "metaData"

```r

dto[["studyName"]]
```

```

## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `physical activity`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script.

View [descriptives : physical activity](https://rawgit.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen-public/master/describe-physact.html) for closer examination of each candidate. 

After reviewing descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `physical activity` have been adopted:


#### Target (1) : `sedentary`   
- `0` - `FALSE` 
- `1` - `TRUE`
  

These variables will be generated next, in the Development section. 

# (II) Development

The particulare goal of this section is to ensure that the schema to encode the values for the `physical activity` variable is consisten across studies. 

In this section we will define the schema sets for harmonizing `physical activity` construct (i.e.  specify which variables from which studies will be contributing to computing harmonized variables ). Each of these schema sets will have a particular pattern of possible response values to these variables, which we will export for inspection as `.csv` tables. We then will manually edit these `.csv` tables, populating new columns that will map values of harmonized variables to the specific response pattern of the schema set variables. We then will import harmonization algorithms encoded in `.csv` tables and apply them to compute harmonized variables in the dataset combining raw and harmonized variables for `physical activity` construct across studies.

## (II.A) 


### (1) Schema sets
Having all potential variables in categorical format we have defined the sets of data schema variables thus: 

Each of these schema sets  have a particular pattern of possible response values, for example:


We output these tables into self-standing `.csv` files, so we can manually provide the logic of computing harmonized variables.



You can examine them in [`./data/meta/response-profiles-live/](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2016-groningen/tree/master/data/meta/response-profiles-live)

## (II.B) `sedentary`

#### Target (1) : `sedentary`   
- `0` - `FALSE` 
- `1` - `TRUE`

### ALSA

Items that can contribute to generating values for the harmonized variable `sedentary`  are:

```r
dto[["metaData"]] %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_name=="alsa", construct %in% c("physact")) %>%
  dplyr::select(study_name, name, label,categories)
```

```
  study_name     name                            label categories
1       alsa EXRTHOUS            Exertion around house         NA
2       alsa HWMNWK2W   Times walked in past two weeks         NA
3       alsa LSVEXC2W Less vigor sessions last 2 weeks         NA
4       alsa LSVIGEXC          Less vigor past 2 weeks         NA
5       alsa TMHVYEXR     Time heavy physical exertion         NA
6       alsa TMVEXC2W          Vigor Time past 2 weeks         NA
7       alsa VIGEXC2W   Vigor Sessions in past 2 weeks         NA
8       alsa  VIGEXCS                Vigorous exercise         NA
9       alsa WALK2WKS             Walking past 2 weeks         NA
```
We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "alsa"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-physact-alsa.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("WALK2WKS", "LSVIGEXC", "VIGEXCS", "EXRTHOUS"), 
  harmony_name = "sedentary"
)
```

We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "lbsl"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-physact-lbsl.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("WALK94","EXCERTOT"), 
  harmony_name = "sedentary"
)

We encode the harmonization rule by manually editing the values in a corresponding `.csv` file located in  `./data/meta/h-rules/`. Then, we apply the recoding logic it contains and append the newly created, harmonized variable to the initial data set. 

```r
study_name <- "tilda"
path_to_hrule <- "./data/meta/h-rules/h-rules-physact-tilda.csv"
dto[["unitData"]][[study_name]] <- recode_with_hrule(
  dto,
  study_name = study_name, 
  variable_names = c("BH105", "BH106", "BH101" ,"BH103"), 
  harmony_name = "sedentary"
)
```

# (III) Recapitulation 

At this point the `dto[["unitData"]]` elements (raw data files for each study) have been augmented with the harmonized variable `sedentary`. We retrieve harmonized variables to view frequency counts across studies: 


```r
dumlist <- list()
for(s in dto[["studyName"]]){
  ds <- dto[["unitData"]][[s]]
  dumlist[[s]] <- ds[,c("id","sedentary")]
}
ds <- plyr::ldply(dumlist,data.frame,.id = "study_name")
head(ds)
```

```
  study_name  id sedentary
1       alsa  41     FALSE
2       alsa  42     FALSE
3       alsa  61      TRUE
4       alsa  71     FALSE
5       alsa  91     FALSE
6       alsa 121      TRUE
```

```r
ds$id <- 1:nrow(ds) # some ids values might be identical, replace
table( ds$sedentary, ds$study_name, useNA="always")
```

```
       
        alsa lbsl satsa share tilda <NA>
  FALSE 1250  470   535  2041  6937    0
  TRUE   814   85   937   553  1562    0
  <NA>    23  101    25     4     5    0
```


Finally, we have added the newly created, harmonized variables to the raw source objects and save the data transfer object.


```r
# Save as a compress, binary R dataset.  It's no longer readable with a text editor, but it saves metadata (eg, factor information).
saveRDS(dto, file="./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds", compress="xz")
```
