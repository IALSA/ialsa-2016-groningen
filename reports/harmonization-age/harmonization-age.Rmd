# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->
```{r load-data, echo=T, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->
```{r inspect-data, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


### (I.A.1) Meta
```{r meta-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Tweak the datasets.   -->
```{r tweak-data, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Basic table view.   -->
```{r basic-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to retrieve all variables potentially tapping the construct `smoking`. These are the candidates to enter the DataSchema and contribute to  computing harmonized variables. 

***NOTE***: what is being retrieved depends on the manually entered values in the column `construct` of the metadata file `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. To specify a different group of variables, edit the  metadata, not the script. 

```{r view-metadata-1, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

View [descriptives : smoking](/reports/harmonization-smoking/harmonization-smoking-basic-graphs.md) for closer examination of each candidate.  After reviewing  these descriptives and relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `smoking` have been adopted:

#### (1) `smoke_now` :  **Are you a smoker presently?**  
  - `0` - NO - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - YES - *unhealthy choice*     
  
#### (2) `smoked_ever` **Have you ever smoked?**  
  - `0` - NO - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - YES - *unhealthy choice*  

These two variables will be manufactured by qualitative harmonization in the Development section. 
 
# (II) Development

In this section we will define the schema sets for harmonizing `smoking` construct (i.e.  specify which variables from which studies will be contributing to computing harmonized variables ). Each of these schema sets (e.g. `"alsa" = c("SMOKER", "PIPCIGAR")`) will have a particular pattern of possible response values to these variables(e.g. "id_1" = c("SMOKER"="YES", "PIPCIGAR"="NO")), which we will export for inspection as `.csv` tables. We then will manually edit these `.csv` tables, populating new columns that will map values of harmonized variables to the specific response pattern of the schema set variables. We then will import harmonization algorithms encoded in `.csv` tables and apply them to compute harmonized variables in the dataset combining raw and harmonized variables for `smoking` construct across studies.
