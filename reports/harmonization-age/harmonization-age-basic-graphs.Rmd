# Exposition

> This report is meant to be compiled after having executed the script `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`, which prepares the necessary data transfer object (DTO). We begin with a brief recap of this script and the DTO it produces.  

## Ellis Island

> All data land on Ellis Island.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->
```{r load-data, echo=T}
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->
```{r inspect-data, echo=T }
```

### Meta
