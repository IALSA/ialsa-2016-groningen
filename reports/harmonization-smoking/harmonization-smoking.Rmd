# (I) Exposition

> This report is a record of interaction with a data transfer object (dto) produced by `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`. 

The next section recaps this script, exposes the architecture of the DTO, and demonstrates the language of interacting with it.   

## (I.A) Ellis Island

> All data are immigrants.

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->
```{r load-data, echo=T, results='asis', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Inspect the datasets.   -->
```{r inspect-data, echo=T, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Tweak the datasets.   -->
```{r tweak-data, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

<!-- Basic table view.   -->
```{r basic-table, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```


## (I.B) Target-H

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

We query metadata set to see what variables are present that tap into the construct `smoking`. These variables constitute the candidates for the DataSchema variables of the harmonized variable.  

```{r view-metadata, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```
After examining the metadata and reviewing  relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `smoking` have been adopted:

#### (1) `smoke_now` :  **Are you a smoker presently?**  
  - `0` - NO - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - YES - *unhealthy choice     
  
#### (2) `smoked_ever` **Have you ever smoked?**  
  - `0` - NO - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - YES - *unhealthy choice*  

These two variables will be manufactured by qualitative harmonization in the Development section. 
 
# (II) Development

Finally we produce a dataset containing the DataSchema variables get schema candidates. 
```{r get-schema-candidates, echo=TRUE, results='show', message=FALSE}
```

View all items in `smoking` construct in [`./reports/harmonization-smoking/data-schema-items.R`](./reports/harmonization-smoking/harmonization-smoking-basic-graphs.html)

## (II.A) `smoke_now`

####  **Are you a smoker presently?**  
  - `0` - NO - *healthy choice*  
  - `1` - YES - *unhealthy choice   

```{r export-response-profiles, echo=TRUE}
```  
  
  
### ALSA

Item that can generate values value for the harmonized variable `smoke_now`  are:
```{r target-1-alsa-1, echo=TRUE}
```
and have the following counts of possible combination of values :
```{r target-1-alsa-2, echo=TRUE}
```

The algorithm of harmonization is spelled out below: 
```{r target-1-alsa-3, echo=TRUE}
```


### LBSL
```{r target-1-alsa-1, echo=TRUE}

### SHARE
### TILDA
