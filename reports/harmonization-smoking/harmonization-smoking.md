# Harmonization exposition : smoking

<!-- These two chunks should be added in the beginning of every .Rmd that you want to source an .R script -->
<!--  The 1st mandatory chunck  -->
<!--  Set the working directory to the repository's base directory -->


<!--  The 2nd mandatory chunck  -->
<!-- Set the report-wide options, and point to the external code file. -->


This report lists the candidate variable for DataScheme variables of the construct **smoking**.

# Exposition

> This report is meant to be compiled after having executed the script `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`, which prepares the necessary data transfer object (DTO). We begin with a brief recap of this script and the DTO it produces.  

## Ellis Island

> All data arrive to Ellis Island. 

The script `0-ellis-island.R` is the first script in the analytic workflow. It accomplished the following: 

- (1) Reads in raw data files from the candidate studies   
- (2) Extract, combines, and exports their metadata (specifically, variable names and labels, if provided) into `./data/shared/derived/meta-data-live.csv`, which is updated every time Ellis Island script is executed.   
- (3) Augments raw metadata with instructions for renaming and classifying variables. The instructions are provided as manually entered values in `./data/shared/meta-data-map.csv`. They are used by automatic scripts in later harmonization and analysis.  
- (4) Combines unit and metadata into a single DTO to serve as a starting point to all subsequent analyses.   

<!-- Load the datasets.   -->

```r
# load the product of 0-ellis-island.R,  a list object containing data and metadata
dto <- readRDS("./data/unshared/derived/dto.rds")

We query metadata set to see what variables are present that tap into the construct `smoking`. These variables constitute the candidates for the DataSchema variables of the harmonized variable.

After examining the metadata and reviewing  relevant codebooks, the following operationalization of the harmonized variables for `smoking` have been adopted:

##### (1). H-Target Item : **Smoke now** 

* Item `smoke_now` :  *Is respondent a current smoker?*
Values:       
  - `0` - no (healthy choice)
  - `1` - yes (unhealthy choice)

##### (2). H-Target Item : **Smoked ever**

* Item `smoked_ever` : *Has respondent every smoked?*
Values:      
 - `0` - no, (healthy choice)
 - `1` - yes, (unhealthy choice)
